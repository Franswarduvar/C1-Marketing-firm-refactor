# C1-Marketing-firm-refactor
I am here to refactor code for a marketing firm.
I have refactored the code to make it more accessable and understanding.
Changing the title element and adding alt elements for the images so they have description.
The semantics and sequential order of the heading atributes looked good and functional for me.
